While most PE class will be occupied by other teachers because they need to make use of the time to help students to do better in the exams. A lot of students feel unsatisfied with it.
At the end of the semester, the students are studying so hard to get better marks in the exams. PE class is expected because only in this time, they can take relax. When they see other teachers walking into the classroom, they feel disappointed and know what will happen next. They will be asked to sit in the classroom again and doing the boring homework.
